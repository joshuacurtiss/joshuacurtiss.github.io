So for years I had a WordPress blog that I hosted where I talked about tech. It was great.
I accumulated a ton of posts and WordPress made it easy. 

Eventually I grew tired of blogging. It was partly a time issue and partly growing tired
of WordPress. And then the hacks started. The security vulnerabilities of WordPress were
pretty much the final straw for me but I didn't want to give up a web presence to 
express myself. If it were only easier, I would continue to post occasional thoughts or 
programming gems as I find them.

Enter [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com). What? Free hosting through GitHub's amazing 
servers? Static HTML that can't be hacked? Writing posts in markdown? Submitting by just
committing files to my Git repository? Is this a dream? 

So I set this thing up and we'll give it a try. For now I'm not importing my old blog
posts because it'd be a bit of work and it is honestly mostly old cruft at this point. 

There is something to be said for fresh starts.

Let the blogging begin!
