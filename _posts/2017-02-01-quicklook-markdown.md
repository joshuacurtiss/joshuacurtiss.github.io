It's annoying that my Mac can [quicklook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Look) normal
text documents or even `js` files but I can't quicklook markdown files. Seems counterintuitive.

Ah, but you can! Check out [qlmarkdown](https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown) on GitHub. It's a
plugin that renders markdown docs in quicklook. Not heavily supported but the author *has* made
some tweaks to keep it running and it seems to work fine in MacOS Sierra. 

Just find the latest version on the [releases](https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown/releases) page and
follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown#installation).
