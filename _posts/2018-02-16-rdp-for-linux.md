What clients to use when connecting to servers from a linux distro? 

The de facto clients that come to mind are [rdesktop](http://www.rdesktop.org) and [FreeRDP](http://www.freerdp.com).  But another really good client is **[Remmina](https://www.remmina.org)** and I'll probably be using this from now on.

Remmina also handles VNC and SSH connectivity, so it handles a lot of use cases. 

Some other options are KDRC, [Vinagre](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Vinagre), and [TightVNC](https://www.tightvnc.com).
