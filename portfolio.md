# Aerial Videography Portfolio #

Aerial photography and videography has been a passion of mine since discovering drones in 2015. I also enjoy the post-production editing work for videos of any kind.

Samples of my work can be found at:

### Additional Editing Work
A sample of my editing work is a [50th Anniversary Presentation](http://bit.ly/curtiss50th) I designed for my parents, which demonstrates photo and video editing with emphasis on composition matching musical presentation.
